# My React Kitchen
In studying React through Trevor Burnham's "Test=Driven React" I want to apply the concepts I learn in a controlled environment that I can access anywhere anytime.

## Organization
Each unit example/project will be in its own respective branch and their versions will be managed via their own sub-branches. The names and the contents of each branch will be detailed in the connected GitHub wiki.

### ⚠️ REMEMBER!!
- Leave this master branch empty it is the origin for making changes with a clean-slate repo.
- If you've been chosen to contribute to this REPO with the plan of changing and testing certain changes, please duplicate the branch and put your name ahead of it, for example:
  - **lordruzki-basicReactDoc**
